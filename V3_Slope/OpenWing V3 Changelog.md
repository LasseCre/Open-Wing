Width for spar cutouts changed to 10.4mm  
Battery compartment height changed from 11mm to 11.5mm  
Changed CG Holes from 109mm to 109.5mm D1,5mm  
~~Changed fuselage diameter from 10.5mm to 9.5mm for BRUXX Arrowshaft~~   
Changed Servo Cutout for X-612 in width (+0.25mm)  
Widened the hole for the 3mm CF tube in the vertical stabilizer from 3.2mm to 3.25mm  
Cutout for servo wire in R01 was made slightly shallower to make support removal easier  
Glue holes over helling parts removed  
Reduced gluehole size from 2mm to 1mm

~~"Vliesscharniere":~~  
~~Pushed rear spars 10mm forward to make space for them~~

~~Glue holes over helling parts~~  
~~Support in R01 is difficult to remove~~  
~~Double launch hole not needed -> Screw fuse solution~~  
~~3mm Hole in VS is to small~~  
~~COG is at 110, not at 113!~~  
~~Glue Holes could be smaller~~  
 
~~Covers are too similar  -> Fix when new Servos are in~~  
VS is too heavy -> Fixing when slicing  

~~Helling could be better -> Self securing~~
