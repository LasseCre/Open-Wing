### Overview
  This is (becoming) the complete documentation for a 3d printable flying wing, including all the information that you need to print and build one   yourself.

  Style: Slightly swept plank
  Wingspan: 2000mm
  Weight: 1150 - 1600g (Depending on Configuration)<br>
  Wingloading: 32g/dm^2 - 43g/dm^2<br>
  Small package size (three part wing)<br>
  Quadroflap<br>
  Lot of carbon reinforcement<br>
  Sailplane for now<br>
  (Motor pod might be added later)<br>

### Structure
  There are different versions available which differ in weigth and components, but they all share the same aerodynamic body.
  Therefore the data in the project is structured as follows:

  0_General Data //Everything that applies to all Versions
    - General Manual //Generalized Manual with a brief description to describe the way the plane is built 
    - Aerodynamics //Profile coordinates, FLZ Files
    - 3D //CAD files of the aerodynamic Body
    - Stuff //Pictures + random stuff thats not fitting anywhere else

  V3 //Everything related specificly to OpenWing V3
    - Manual V3 //Manual reagrding everything thats special about V3
    - Order List //List containing all the items you need and sources where you can buy it
    - Print //Files that are directly related to printing
        - Cura files //Cura files that are ready to slice
        - Ender3-DD-GCodes //GCodes for PLA on Ender 3 with direct drive
        - Ender3-GCodes //GCodes for PLA on Ender 3
    - 3D //All files containing 3D geometry
        - SWX //Solidworks files
        - Step //Step files
        - STL //Stl files

V4 //Everything related specificly to OpenWing V4
    - Manual V4 //Manual reagrding everything thats special about V4
    - Order List //List containing all the items you need and sources where you can buy it
    - Print //Files that are directly related to printing
        - Cura files //Cura files that are ready to slice
        - Ender3-DD-GCodes //GCodes for PLA on Ender 3 with direct drive
        - Ender3-GCodes //GCodes for PLA on Ender 3
    - 3D //All files containing 3D geometry
        - SWX //Solidworks files
        - Step //Step files
        - STL //Stl files

X_Deprecated // Old data that is kept only for nostalgic reasons



Please note that the Plane was previously called "Oso", which is still apparent in some of the file names<br>
This is a private project!
