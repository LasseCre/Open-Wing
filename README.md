### Overview
This is (becoming) the complete documentation for a 3d printable flying wing, including all the information that you need to print and build one yourself.
I recommend to read the general [Manual]('0_General%20Data/General%20Manual.md') before you start printing.

Style: Slightly swept plank  
Wingspan: 2000mm  
Weight: 1150 - 1600g (Depending on Configuration)  
Wingloading: 32g/dm^2 - 43g/dm^2  
Material: PLA
Print Time: Approx. 10 Days  
Small transport size (three part wing)  
Quadroflap  
Lots of carbon reinforcement  
Sailplane for now  
(Motor pod might be added later)  


### Structure
There are different versions available which differ in weigth and components, but they all share the same aerodynamic body.  
Therefore the data in the project is structured as follows:  

- **0_General Data** | *Everything that applies to all Versions*
- **V3_Slope** | *Sturdy and a little heavier, perfect for sloping and high speeds - Everything Ready!*
- **V4_Allround** | *The perfect wing to fly all the time - Light enough for light conditions, and strong enough to have fun with... - Available on demand*
- **V5_Convenience** | *Some measures taken, to make printing and assembly as easy as possible! - In Progress!*  
- **X_Deprecated** | *Old data that is kept only for nostalgic reasons*  



Please note that the Plane was previously called "Oso", which is still apparent in some of the file names  
This is a private project!
